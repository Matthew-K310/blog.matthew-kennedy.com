## Abstract {#abstract}

The brain throws away information it deems as useless or unimportant.
To properly learn a language, we must train our brain to see it as useful
information by immediately putting it into practice, and using it to fulfill
a need we have, whether that be a gap in our workflow, or a simple little tool
that makes a task just that _little_ bit faster.


## Notes {#notes}

Oglo recommends a 4-step process:

1.  Learn the fundamentals
    To learn any language, you must understand the basic concepts.
    "How do functions work in x?"
    "How do you write an if statement in y?"
    For this, you should find a playlist of YouTube videos about that language,
    and watch the first five (i.e. [System Crafters' ELisp course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQK_DaaX34Q&list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPQtn7FQEF3D7sroZbXuPZ7)). This should
    give you the baseline understanding of that language, and that can get you
    pretty far.

2.  Start a project
    When I say "Start a project", I don't mean just start some random garbage
    project that will never be used by you (I'm looking at you [ls-hs](https://codeberg.org/Matthew-K310/ls-hs) and [ls-go](https://codeberg.org/Matthew-K310/ls-go)).
    Build something that will fill a gap in your workflow, or fulfill a need
    that you have.
    Some examples:
    -   A better password manager (especially since Bitwarden almost dumped
        a friend's entire vault due to a faulty update)
    -   An [Emacs package to port an Obsidian feature over](https://codeberg.org/Matthew-K310/bases.el)
    -   A little script to make downloading vast amounts of music off of YouTube
        just a little easier

        Wait... what?

        Don't worry about it :D

3.  Learn as you go
    When you encounter a concept in a language that you haven't yet learned, look
    it up. Don't copy and paste the code from whatever site (most likely
    StackOverflow), but actually type it out, understand it, and put it into
    practice as soon as you learn it.
    This is part of teaching our brains to metabolize this concept and tag it as
    useful and important information that should not be thrown out the next time
    you have an Out of RAM error and need to clear your cache.

4.  Ask someone with more experience
    This is pretty self explanatory.
    Ask someone you know (or don't know, in the case of the internet) to take a
    look at a project you may be working on. Chances are, they'll have some
    constructive feedback that you can put into practice (unless you ask
    Reddit... never ask Reddit)
