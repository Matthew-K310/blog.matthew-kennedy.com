  <h1>A Greeting</h1>
  <p><em>Oct 9, 2025</em></p>

  <div>
    <p>To anyone reading this: <strong>Welcome!</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of starting a blog for a while, but I never quite knew where to start-so I kept putting it off.</p>
<p>Well, I’ve started.</p>
<p>I have a simple plan for this: to make it my social media replacement. I really, truly dislike the way modern social media has been going for a while now, but I still enjoy keeping up with people I don’t often get to see in person.</p>
<p>This blog will be a place for TILs (see <a href="https://github.com/jbranchaud/til">Josh Branchaud&rsquo;s TIL repo</a>), micro-blogging, and longer posts. The longer posts will most likely come from lesson plans or other larger notes and projects. I’m planning to take a month-long deep dive into Biblical canonization, so expect to see that sometime next month.</p>
<p>Thank you for indulging me-and I&rsquo;ll see you in the next one.</p>
<p>God bless,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
