Technology is everywhere in our daily lives.
At work and school, computers have become an essential part of how we work, to
the point that the vast majority of tasks can&rsquo;t be done away from a screen.
At home, we spend our free time on our phones, computers, or TVs, seeking an
escape from the struggles of daily life, and the horrifying notion of being
alone with our own thoughts.">

<p>Whether it be TikTok, Instagram, or the porn industry, all of these
platforms promise some sort of satisfaction, fulfillment, joy, or pleasure.</p>
<ul>
<li>TikTok promises fulfillment and joy via popularity/recognition, and being
able to keep up with the latest trends.</li>
<li>The porn industry promises sexual satisfaction and limitless pleasure via
a large pool of scenarios and porn types.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these promises are almost always left unfulfilled in the long term,
with us ending up spending more and more time scrolling to find the perfect
video, or watching more and more debauched porn to sate our ever growing
desire.</p>

<p>While we may not always see it this way, laziness/sloth is a sin, and it is one
of the most dangerous in my opinion.
Laziness is what keeps me from spending as much time in the Word as I would
like, because it seems so much easier to just go back to sleep than to wake up
and do my Bible study.
It&rsquo;s so much easier to watch YouTube, or one more episode of $SHOW, instead of
actually getting done the things I need to do, whether it be work, school,
a personal project, or just spending time with the Lord.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proverbs 21:25</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The desire of the sluggard kills him,
for his hands refuse to labor.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proverbs 18:9</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoever is slack in his work
is a brother to him who destroys.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proverbs 6:6-11</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go to the ant, O sluggard;
consider her ways, and be wise.
Without having any chief,
officer, or ruler,
she prepares her bread in summer
and gathers her food in harvest.
How long will you lie there, O sluggard?
When will you arise from your sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber,
a little folding of the hands to rest,
and poverty will come upon you like a robber,
and want like an armed man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This return back to simpler technology and more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0s2sUu5zW0"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dedicated tools</a> has seen many

<p>When trying to kick a bad habit or an addiction, you must <em>always</em> have something
to replace it with.</p>
<ul>
<li>A smoker usually have to have some other sort of oral fixation early on in the
rehab process.</li>
</ul>
<p>We must replace our bad habits with something more beneficial, more useful.
This can include things like reading, writing, making music, programming, etc.</p>
<p>Reading can be a fun pastime that doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of effort, or it can be
something you do for the sake of learning or teaching yourself something new and
interesting to you (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">autodidacticism</a>).</p>
<p>Creating art of any sort (and yes, programming is art) can be a good outlet for
whatever is going on in your life, and is a whole lot better than scrolling to
escape your thoughts.</p>
<p>Writing can help you better understand your own thoughts, or metabolize
information on an unfamiliar subject.
In the case of learning, I would recommend writing with pen and paper, as that
<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614524581?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been shown</a> to improve the metabolization and comprehension of new
information.</p>
<p>For Christians, habit substitution can come in the form of spending more time
reading and studying Scripture, spending time in prayer, or even reading
theological books - which is a great boon to our walk with the Lord.</p>
<p>(I recommend <a href="https://www.wtsbooks.com/products/daily-doctrine-a-one-year-guide-to-systematic-theology-9781433572852"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Doctrine</a> by Kevin DeYoung as an intro to systematic

<p>All of this can be summed up in four questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What effect is this having on my ability to see Jesus and to know His love?</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I willing to cut this off<!-- raw HTML omitted --> if it hinders my attention to Jesus and His love?</li>
<li>What other pursuit better directs my attention to Jesus and His love?</li>
<li><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Am I willing to endure the pain<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of taking ownership of my attention so that I can better focus on Jesus and His love?</li>
